The theme of our game revolves around Kiki's Delivery Service, a 1989 Japanese animated fantasy film by the amazing Hayao Miyazaki. 

Once upon a time, there was a young witch named Kiki. Since she has turned 13 this year, as per tradition, she must live away from home for a year to develop her witch skills. 
*Picture of her flying away from home and the new place perhaps?*
Upon settling in her new town, Kiki meets a nice baker named Osono who agrees to let Kiki stay with her on the condition that she helps around the bakery and allows her to make her own money by making deliveries.
